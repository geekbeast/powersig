# PowerSig Benchmarks

This directory contains benchmarks for comparing PowerSig with other signature kernel libraries.

## Quick Start

To run the benchmarks, follow these steps:

1. Install the benchmark requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Run from the project root.
   ```
   PYTHONPATH=. python benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py
   ```

Benchmarks currently require a CUDA enabled device.
